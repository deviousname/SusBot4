  During any of the following functions you can press 'j' to stop.  (Image Paster, Trees, Mongus, Rectangles):

    Colorfilter:

  Choosing a color and pressing the '1-9' keys will equip it to that slot. Meaning you may have up to 9 colorfilters.
  
  Pressing '0' will remove all equipped filters. Filters are used in the other functions as defined below.

    Image Paster:

  First you need to select the area you want to copy, and it will only copy pixelplace colors.
  
  It will not copy colors you have put in your color filter. This allows transparency effects.
  
  To select and area, first move your mouse to the lop left most corner of the area and press 'y'
  
  Then move your mouse to the bottom right most corner and press 'u'. The image is copied now.
  
  To paste the image somewhere else, move your mouse to that spot and press 'p' to paste.
  
  Once it is finished it will move the mouse back to the center of the image you pasted.
  
  Pressing '[' will mark your location, you can overwrite it with each subsequent [ press.
  
  Pressing 'Shift + [' will remove the marker. Use this to save your spot when using Image Paster.
  
    Retangle & Selective Retangle:

  First mark an area with 'y' and 'u' as shown in the image paster section. 
  
  Select the color you want to use and press ' to paint that color in the area.
  
  The selective rectangle will only paint on top of colors in your Colorfilter list.
  
  Activate selective rectangle with the ';' key.
  
    Trees & Among Us:
  
  If you want to draw random Among Us or Trees press 'k' or 'r' after marking an area with 'y' and 'u'
  
    Colorbrushes:
  
  The 'wasd' and 'q' keys when held down with the Spacebar will paint various color patterns with your brush strokes.
  
  'q' has every color, and the various 'wasd' combos, i.e. 'w+a' or 's+d' have selective palettes.
  
  There is a known bug that if you try to click while actively using the brush, the map will fly away from you.
  
  The trick is to move the map when you are not holding down Spacebar if you need to move it.
  
    Miscellaneous:
  
  Pressing 'x' will toggle guild war logos on and off.
  
  Pressing 'Home' will load the default Pixelplace.io page (so you can easily reset your zoom level to 1)
